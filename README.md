  ## Description

  This application allows a user to view, create, and track daily workouts. The user can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user can even track the distance traveled. 

  This project was created using a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express. It used Atlas for the server-side database storage and was deployed using Heroku.
